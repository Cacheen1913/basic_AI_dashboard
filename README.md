#AI-Powered Dashboard Assistant

The project is an AI-powered interactive dashboard built using Python and Streamlit, integrated with a conversational AI model (Gemini). The dashboard allows users to ask questions, receive written responses, and also hear the answers through text-to-speech audio output.

FEATURES
1. AI Chat Interface

Users can type any question or query.

The AI responds with clear, structured, and accurate answers.

The system uses a Generative AI model (Gemini) to understand and reply.

2. Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)

Every AI response is converted into audio.

Helps with accessibility and improves user experience.

3. Clean & Modern Dashboard UI

Built using Streamlit for a fast, interactive, web-based interface.

Minimal and professional design with simple navigation.

Works on any device (laptop, mobile, tablet).

HOW IT WORKS

The user enters a question in the input box.

The AI model processes the query using an API (Gemini).

The response is displayed instantly in text form.

The same text is converted to speech using a TTS engine and played in the dashboard.
